insulins.  
MOUNJARO  is not a substitute for insulin . 
MOUNJARO should not be used in patients with type  1 diabetes mellitus (formerly known as insulin -dependent 
diabetes mellitus or IDDM) . 
MOUNJARO  should not be used for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.  
1.1 Pediatrics   
Pediatrics (<18 years of age):  The safety and efficacy of MOUNJARO  have not been studied in pediatric 
patients. MOUNJARO  is not indicated for use in pediatric patients . 
1.2 Geriatrics   
Geriatrics (≥65 years of age):  No overall differences in safety or efficacy were observed in clinical trial 
patients ≥65 years of age compared to younger patients  (see 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , 7.1.4
 Geriatrics , and 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 
2 CONTRAINDICATIONS   
MOUNJARO is contraindicated:

MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 5 of 61 
 3 SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  BOX   
Serious Warnings  and Precautions  
RISK OF THYROID C -CELL TUMORS  
 Tirzepatide causes dose -dependent and treatment -duration -dependent thyroid C -cell 
tumors (adenomas and carcinoma s) at clinically relevant exposures  in male and female  rats 
(see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). It is unknown whether MOUNJARO  causes 
thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) in humans . The human 
relevance of tirzepatide -induced rodent thyroid C -cell tumors has not been determined  (see 
7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). 
 MOUNJARO  is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC and in 
patients with Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type  2 (MEN  2). It is unknown 
whether monitoring with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound will mitigate human risk of 
thyroid C -cell tumors. Patients should be counseled regarding the risk and symptoms of 
thyroid tumors (see 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS , 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS , 
8 ADVERSE REACTIONS  and 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). 
 
4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION   
4.1 Dosing Considerations   
An increased risk of hypoglycemia was seen with concomitant use of a sulfon ylurea  or basal insulin with 
MOUNJARO  To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia , a reduction in the dose of insulin secretagogue  or insulin 
should be considered when  MOUNJARO is added to either of these existing therapies . In a clinical trial  in 
patients with a baseline HbA1c ≤8%,  the basal insulin dose was decreased by 20% when  treatment with  
MOUNJARO  was initiated  (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  and 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). 
4.2 Recommended Dose and Dosage Adjustment   
 The recommended starting dose of MOUNJARO  is 2.5  mg injected subcutaneously only once weekly.  The 
2.5 mg dosage is for treatment initiation and is not intended for glycemic control.  After 4 weeks,  increase 
the dose to 5  mg injected subcutaneously  once weekly.  
 If additional glycemic control is needed, increase the dosage  in 2.5  mg increments after no less than  4 
weeks on the current dose.  
 The maximum dose is 15  mg injected subcutaneously once weekly.  
 Renal Insufficiency:  No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment (see 10.3
 Pharmacokinetics ). 
 Hepatic Insufficiency:  No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with hepatic insufficiency  (see 10.3
 Pharmacokinetics ). 
 Geriatrics (≥65 years): No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age  (see 7.1.4
 Geriatrics  and 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 
 Pediatrics (<18 years):  The safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO  have not been studied in patients 
under 18 years of age . MOUNJARO is not indicated for pediatric use  (see 7.1.3  Pediatrics ). 
4.4 Administration   
 Prior  to initiation of MOUNJARO, train patients on proper injection technique. Advise the patient to carefully 
read the  Instructions for Use included with the Patient Medication Information  leaflet  before administering 
the medicinal product.   
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 6 of 61 
  Patients  using the single -dose vial  must be i nstruct ed to use a syringe equipped with a needle appropriate 
for subcutaneous injection (for example, a tuberculin or insulin  syringe with a 28- to 31-gauge needle  more 
than 2.1  mm in length that is capable of measuring a 0.5 mL dose volume ). 
 Administer MOUNJARO once weekly , any time of day, with or without meals. MOUNJARO should not be 
administered daily.  
 MOUNJARO is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, in the thigh, or in the upper arm. Rotate 
injection sites with each dose.  
 Visually inspect MOUNJARO before use. It should appear clear and colo urless to slightly yellow. Do not 
use MOUNJARO if particulate matter or discoloration is seen.  
 When using MOUNJARO with insulin, administer as separate injections and never mix. It is acceptable to 
inject MOUNJARO and insulin in the same body region, but the injections should not be adjacent to each 
other . 
 MOUNJARO should not be administered intramuscularly or intravenously.  
 Patients using the single -dose prefilled pen or vial go through 4 different pens or vials per month.  
 Patients using the multi -dose prefilled pen ( MOUNJARO KwikPen) go through 1  MOUNJARO  KwikPen per 
month as one pen delivers 4 doses of the same concentration of tirzepatide.   
4.5 Missed Dose   
If a dose is missed, instruct patients to administer as soon as possible within 4 days (96 hours ) after the 
missed dose. If more than 4 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the 
regularly scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once -weekly dosing schedule.  
Changing Weekly Dosing Schedule  
The day of weekly administration can be changed, if necessary, as long as the time between two doses is at 
least  3 days (72 hours).  
5 OVERDOSAGE   
Potential symptoms from an overdose could be gastrointestinal related (e.g., nausea).  In the event of 
overdose, appropriate supportive care (including frequent blood  glucose monitoring) should be initiated 
according to the patient’s clinical signs and symptoms.  A prolonged period of observation and treatment for 
these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the long half -life of MOUNJARO . 
For management of a suspected drug overdose, contact your regional poison control centre.

7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS   
Please see 3 SERIOUS WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  BOX . 
General  
MOUNJARO KwikPen contains 5.4  mg benzyl alcohol in each 0.6  mL dose. Patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment should be informed of the potential risk of metabolic acidosis due to accumulation of benzyl alcohol 
over time. Benzyl alcohol may cause allergic reaction s (see 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS ). 
Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis  
Risk of Thyroid C -Cell Tumors  
Tirzepatide  caused a dose -dependent and treatment -duration -dependent increase in the incidence of thyroid 
C-cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas) in both sexes of rats in a two -year study  at clinically relevant 
plasma exposures (see  16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). It is unknown whether MOUNJARO causes 
thyroid C -cell tumors, including MTC, in humans as human relevance could not be determined. Thyroid C -cell 
tumors in rodents are a known effect for GLP -1 receptor agonists.  
MOUNJARO  is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or in patients with Multiple 
Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type  2 (MEN  2). Counsel patients regarding the potential risk for MTC with the 
use of MOUNJARO  and inform them of symptoms of thyroid tumors (e.g. , a mass in the neck, dysphagia, 
dyspnea, persistent hoarseness).  
In registration clinical trials, there were no cases of MTC observed in patients treated with MOUNJARO . 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 8 of 61 
 It is unknown whether monitoring with serum calcitonin or thyroid ultrasound will mitigate the potential risk of 
MTC, and such monitoring may increase the risk of unnecessary procedures, due to low test specificity of 
serum calcitonin and a high background  incidence of thyroid disease. However, if serum calcitonin is measured 
and found to be elevated, the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation . Similarly, 
patients with thyroid nodules noted on physical examination or neck imaging obtained for other reasons should 
be referred to an endocrinologist for further evaluation.  
Cardiovascular  
Heart Rate Increase  
MOUNJARO  causes an increase in heart rate. Caution should be observed in patients who have cardiac 
conditions that might be worsened by an increase in heart rate (see 9.4 ). 
Heart Failure  
There is no therapeutic experience in patients with congestive heart failure New York Heart Association 
(NYHA) class IV.  
Endocrine and Metabolism  
Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use of Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin  
Patients receiving MOUNJARO  in combination with an insulin secretagogue ( e.g., a sulfonylurea) or insulin 
may have an increased risk of hypoglycemia. The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the 
dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin (see 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions , 9.2 Drug Interactions 
Overview ). 
Other Incretin Drugs 
The use of MOUNJARO  in combination with other  incretin  drugs (e.g., GLP-1 receptor agonists  or DPP -4 
inhibitors ) has not been studied  and MOUNJARO should not be used in combination with those drugs . It is 
unknown if concomitant use of drugs acting via similar pathways affects the efficacy and safety of 
MOUNJARO . 
Gastrointestinal  
Use of MOUNJARO  has been  associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, sometimes severe (see 8.2
 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). MOUNJARO  has not been studied in patients with severe 
gastrointestinal disease, including severe gastroparesis, and therefore should be used with caution in these 
patients . Events related to impaired gastric emptying, including severe gastroparesis, have been reported. 
Monitor and consider dose modification or discontinuation in patients who develop severe gastrointestinal 
symptoms while on treatment . 
Malnutrition  
Malnutrition has been reported in patients receiving MOUNJARO, including severe, serious and fatal events. 
Nutritional guidance and supplementation should be considered for patients receiving MOUNJARO. 
Discontinuation should be considered for severe or per sistent cases of malnutrition.  
Hepatic/Biliary  
Acute Gallbladder Disease  
Acute events of gallbladder disease  such as  chole lithiasis or cholecystitis have been reported in GLP-1 
receptor agonist clinical trials  and post-marketing . 
In MOUNJARO placebo -controlled trials, acute gallbladder disease (i .e., acute cholecystitis, biliary colic, and 
chole cystectomy) was reporte d by 0.6% of MOUNJARO -treated patients  and 0% of placebo -treated patients.  
If cholelithiasis is suspected, gallbladder diagnostic studies and appropriate clinical follow -up are indicated.  
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 9 of 61 
 Immune  
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with MOUNJARO  in clinical trials . There  have been 
postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. anaphylactic reactions and angioedema) in 
patients treated with MOUNJARO. If hypersensitivity reactions occur, discontinue use of MOUNJARO ; treat 
promptly per standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Do not use in patients with a 
previous hypersensitivity to tirzepatide or any of the excipients in MOUNJARO  (see 2
 CONTRAINDICATIONS ). 
Anaphylaxis and angioedema have been reported with GLP -1 receptor agonists. Use MOUNJARO with 
caution in patient s with a history of angioedema or anaphylaxis with a GLP -1 receptor agonist or related 
products because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to anaphylaxis with MOUNJARO.  
Monitoring and Laboratory Tests  
Regular self -monitoring of blood glucose is not needed in order to adjust the dose of MOUNJARO . However, 
when initiating treatment with MOUNJARO  in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, self-monitoring of 
blood glucose may become necessary to reduce the dose of the sulfonylurea or insulin in order to reduce the 
risk of hypoglycemia.  
Patients should be informed that response to all diabetic therapies should be monitored by periodic 
measurement of HbA1c levels, with a goal of decreasing these levels towards the normal range. HbA1c is 
useful for evaluating long -term glycemic control.  
Ophthalmologic  
Diabetic Retinopathy Complications  
Rapid improvement in glucose control has been associated with a temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. 
MOUNJARO  has not been studied in patients with non -proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute 
therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or diabetic macular edema, and should be used with caution in these 
patients, with appropriate monitoring.  
Pancreatic  
Pancreat itis 
Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients treated with GLP -1 receptor agonist s. In MOUNJARO  clinical  
studies, 14 events of acute pancreatitis were confirmed by adjudication in 13  (0.2%)  MOUNJARO -treated 
patients (0.23 patients per 100 years of exposure) versus 3 events in 3 (0.1%)  comparator -treated patients 
(0.11 patients per 100 years of exposure ). 
After initiation of MOUNJARO , observe patients carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis.  Patients 
should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis.  In the absence of other signs and 
symptoms of pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic enzymes alone are not predictive of pancreatitis.  If 
pancreatitis is suspected, MOUNJARO  should be discontinued and appropriate management initiated; if 
confirmed, MOUNJARO  should not be restarted. MOUNJARO  has not been evaluated in patients with a prior 
history of pancreatitis and should be used with caution in these patients.  
Peri-operative considerations  
Aspiration during General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation  
MOUNJARO  delays gastric emptying. Pulmonary aspiration has been reported in patients receiving long -acting 
GLP-1 receptor agonists undergoing general anesthesia or deep sedation.  For the safe management of 
patients, consider the benefits and risks , and advise patients of these, prior to such procedures . 
Psychiatric  
Suicidal  Ideation  and Behaviour  
Monitor patients treated with MOUNJARO for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or 
behaviours, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behaviour.  Consider the benefits and risks to individual 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 10 of 61 
 patients prior to initiating or continuing therapy in patients with suicidal thoughts or behaviours, or those who 
have a history of suicidal attempts.  
Renal  
Acute Kidney Injury  
MOUNJARO  has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, vomiting, and 
diarrhea (see 8 ADVERSE REACTIONS ). These events may lead to dehydration, which could cause a 
deterioration in renal function including acute renal failure.  
In patients treated with GLP -1 receptor agonists , there have been post -marketing reports of acute kidney injury 
and worsening of chronic renal failure, which may sometimes require hemodialysis. Some of these events 
have been reported in patients without known underlying renal disease. A majority of the reported events 
occurre d in patients who had experienced nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or dehydration. Monitor renal function 
when initiating or escalating doses of MOUNJARO  in patients reporting severe adverse  gastrointestinal 
reactions.  
Reproductive Health: Female and Male Potential  
Women of childbearing potential are recommended to use contraception when treated with tirzepatide.  
MOUNJARO is contraindicated during pregnancy (see 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS , 7.1.1  Pregnant 
Women , and 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). 
Advise patients using oral hormonal contraceptives to switch to a non -oral contraceptive method, or add a 
barrier method of contraception for 4 weeks after initiation and for 4 weeks after each dose escalation with 
MOUNJARO  (see 9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions ). 
7.1 Special Populations   
7.1.1  Pregnant Women   
No clinical trials in pregnant women have been conducted. Studies in animals  (i.e., rats and rabbits)  have 
shown reproductive and developmental toxicity , including harm to fetal development and maternal weight loss  
(see 16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY ). The e xtent of exposure in pregnancy during clinical trials  is 
very limited and has been reported in individual cases only.  
MOUNJARO  is contraindicated  during pregnancy (see 2 CONTRAINDICATIONS ). If a patient wishes to 
become pregnant, MOUNJARO  should be discontinued  at least 1 month before a planned pregnancy due to 
the long half-life of  MOUNJARO . 
7.1.2  Breast -feeding   
There are no data on the presence of tirzepatide in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the 
effects on milk production.  MOUNJARO  is contraindicated  for the duration of breast -feeding  (see 2
 CONTRAINDICATIONS ). 
7.1.3  Pediatrics   
Safety and effectiveness of MOUNJARO  have not been established in pediatric patients. MOUNJARO  is not 
indicat ed for use in patients younger than 18 years.  
7.1.4  Geriatrics   
No dose adjustment is required in patients over 65 years of age (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 
In clinical  trials,1539  (30.1%) MOUNJARO -treated patients were 65 years of age or older and 212 (4.1%) 
MOUNJARO -treated patients were 75 years of age or older at baseline.  
No overall differences in safety or efficacy were detected between these patients and younger patients, but 
greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.  
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 11 of 61 
 7.1.5  Hepatic Impairment   
In a clinical pharmacology study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, no change in 
tirzepatide pharmacokinetics ( PK) was observed (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). However, there is limited 
clinical experience in patients with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment; therefore, use MOUNJARO  
with caution in these patient populations.  
7.1.6  Renal Impairment   
In clinical  trials, 2140 (39.5%) of MOUNJARO -treated patients had mild renal impairment (eGFR ≥60 but 
<90 mL/min/1.73  m2), 393 (7.3%) MOUNJARO -treated patients had moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥30 but 
<60 mL/min/1.73  m2) and 12 (0.2%) had severe renal impairment (eGFR <30  mL/min/1.73  m2) at baseline . 
MOUNJARO  is not recommende d in patients with end stage renal impairment due to very limited clinical 
experience with MOUNJARO  in this population  (see 10.3 Pharmacokinetics ). 
8 ADVERSE REACTIONS   
8.1 Adverse Reaction Overview   
The most frequently reported adverse reactions in clinical trials were gastrointestinal disorders, including 
nausea, diarrhea and vomiting. In general, these reactions were mild or moderate in severity . Gastrointestinal  
adverse reactions  (4.2%)  were the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation (see 8.2 Clinical Trial 
Adverse Reactions ). The following serious adverse reactions are described below or elsewhere in the Product 
Monograph:  
 Risk of Thyroid C -cell Tumors (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Pancreatitis (see  7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Diabetic Retinopathy Complications (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Use with Medications Known to Cause Hypoglycemia (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Renal Insufficiency (see 7WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Suicidal  Ideation  and Behaviour  (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Aspiration  during General Anesthesia or Deep Sedation (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
 Malnutrition  (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ) 
8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions   
Clinical trials are conducted under very specific conditions . Therefore, t he adverse reaction rates observed in 
the clinical trials  may not reflect the rates observed in practice and should not be compared to the rates in the 
clinical trials of another drug . Adverse reaction inf ormation from clinical trials may be  useful in  identifying  and 
approximating rates of adverse  drug reactions in real -world use.  
All phase 3 studies assessed MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg and 15  mg. 
Pool of Placebo -Controlled Trials  
The placebo -controlled data in Table  2 are derived from 2 trials (1 monotherapy trial and 1 trial in combination 
with basal insulin with or without metformin) in patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus (see 14 ). These data 
reflect exposure of 718 patients to MOUNJARO  and a mean duration of exposure to MOUNJARO  of 36.6 
weeks.  
Pool of Phase 3 Placebo and Active -Controlled Trials  
The MOUNJARO  data for all phase 3 trials  in Table  2 are derived from a pool of patients with type  2 diabetes 
mellitus participating in 7 placebo - or active -controlled Phase  3 glycemic control trials (see 14 ) evaluating 
the use of MOUNJARO  as monotherapy and add -on therapy to oral glucose -lowering medications or insulin. In 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 12 of 61 
 this pool, a total of 5119 patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus were treated with MOUNJARO  for a mean 
duration of 48.1 weeks.  
Common Adverse Reactions  
Table  2 shows common adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia  (shown in Table  3), associated with the 
use of MOUNJARO  in the pool of placebo -controlled  and pool of phase 3 placebo - and active -controlled trials. 
These adverse reactions occurred more commonly with MOUNJARO  than with placebo, and occurred in at 
least 1% of patients treated with MOUNJARO .

Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions  
In the pool of phase 3 placebo -controlled trials, gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurred more frequently 
among patients receiving MOUNJARO  than patients receiving placebo : MOUNJARO  5 mg (37.1%), 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 13 of 61 
 MOUNJARO  10 mg (39.6%), MOUNJARO  15 mg (43.6%), (placebo 20.4% ). These events were typically mild 
or moderate in severity. More patients receiving MOUNJARO  5 mg (3 .0%), MOUNJARO  10 mg (5.4%), and 
MOUNJARO  15 mg (6.6%) discontinued treatment due to gastrointestinal adverse reactions compared to  
patients receiving placebo (0.4%). The majority of reports of nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occurred during 
dose escalation and decreased over time.  
In the pool of 7 phase 3 registration studies (placebo -controlled plus active comparator), gastrointestinal events 
occurred in 38.0% of patients on MOUNJARO  5 mg, 43.8% of patients on MOUNJARO  10 mg, and 48.8% of 
patients on MOUNJARO  15 mg. For patients who reported gastrointestinal adverse reactions, investigators 
graded the maximum severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions occurring on MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, 
and 15  mg as "mild" in 66%, 66%, and 65% of patients, “moderate” in 29%, 30%, 32%, or "severe"  in 5%, 4%, 
and 3% of patients, respectively.

Hypoglycemia was more frequent when MOUNJARO  was used in combination with a sulfonylurea or basal 
insulin than when used with non -secretagogues (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). In study 
SURPASS -4, severe hypoglycemia occurred in 0.5%, 0.0%, 0.6% and 1.1% of patients when MOUNJARO  
5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg or insulin glargine, respectively , was co-administered with a sulfonylurea. Severe  
hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia with glucose <3.0 mmol/L occurred in 13.8%, 9.9%, 12.9% and 21.6% of 
patients when MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg or insulin glargine, respectively , was co -administered with a 
sulfonylurea.  
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 14 of 61 
 In the SURPASS -2 study , severe hypo glycemia or hypoglycemia  with glucose <3.0 mmol/L  occurred in 0.9%, 
0.2%, 1.7% and 0.4% of patients when MOUNJARO 5  mg, 10  mg, 15  mg or semaglutide 1  mg, respectively , 
was co-administered with metformin . 
In the SURPASS -3 study , no cases of severe hypoglycemia occurred when MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg 
or insulin degludec, was co -administered with a SGLT2i. Severe hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia with glucose 
<3.0 mmol/L  occurred in 1.8%, 1.7%, 2.7% and 8.6% of patients when MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg or 
insulin degludec, respectively , was co -administered with a SGLT2i.  
Immunogenicity  
Across seven Phase  3 clinical studies, 2,570 (51.1%) MOUNJARO -treated patients developed anti -drug 
antibodies (ADAs). Of the 2,570 MOUNJARO -treated patients that developed tirzepatide ADAs, 94 (1.9% of 
the overall population) and 107 (2.1% of the overall population) had neutralizing antibodies against tirzepatide 
activity on the GIP and GLP -1 receptors , respectively , and 43  (0.9% of the overall population) and 18 (0.4% of 
the overall population) had neutralizing antibodies against native GIP and GLP -1, resp ectively. There was no 
evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile, or an impact on efficacy and safety associated with the 
development of ADAs.  
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. 
Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody positivity (including neutralizing antibody) in an assay may be 
influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, 
concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, the incidence of antibodies to  tirzepatide 
cannot be directly compared with the incidence of antibodies of other products . 
Hypersensitivity Reactions  
Hypersensitivity reactions , sometimes severe (e.g., urticaria  and eczema ), have been reported in clinical trials 
with MOUNJARO . 
In the pool of placebo -controlled trials, hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.2% of MOUNJARO -treated 
patients compared to 1.7% of placebo -treated patients.  
In the pool of seven clinical trials, hypersensitivity reactions occurred in 106/2,570 (4.1%) of MOUNJARO -
treated patients with anti -tirzepatide antibodies and in 73/2,455 (3.0%) of MOUNJARO -treated patients who did 
not develop anti -tirzepatide antibodies (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ). 
Injection Site Reactions  
In the pool of placebo -controlled trials, injection site reactions were reported in 3.2% of MOUNJARO -treated 
patients compared to 0.4% of placebo -treated patients. In the pool of seven clinical trials, injection site 
reactions occurred in 119/2,570 (4.6%) of MOUNJARO -treated patients with anti -tirzepatide antibodies and in 
18/2,455 (0.7%) of MOUNJARO -treated patients who did not develop anti -tirzepatide antibodies.  
8.3 Less Common Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions   
Hepa tobiliary disorders: acute gallbladder disease  
Pancreatic disorders: pancreatitis  
Nervous System Disorders:  dysgeusia  
8.4 Abnormal Laboratory Findings: Hematologic, Clinical Chemistry and Other Quantitative Data   
Pancreatic Enzymes  
Amylase and lipase were measured in the clinical trials. Treatment with tirzepatide resulted in mean  increases 
from baseline in  pancreatic amylase of 33%  to 38% and lipase of 31% to 42%.  The percentage of patients with 
values above 3 times the upper limit of normal for amylase or lipase at any timepoint on -treatment after 
baseline are presented below. The clinical significance of elevations of amylase or lipase in patients without 
other si gns and symptoms of pancreatitis is unknown (see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS ).

8.5 Post -market Adverse Reactions   
The following additional adverse reactions have been reported  during post -approval use of MOUNJARO. 
Because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to 
reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.  
Gastrointestinal disorders: ileus 
Immune system disorders : anaphylactic reaction  
Nervous system disorders:  dysesthesia  
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders:  angioedema  
9 DRUG INTERACTIONS   
9.2 Drug Interactions Overview   
MOUNJARO  delays gastric emptying, and thereby has the potential to impact the absorption of concomitantly 
administered oral medications. The impact of tirzepatide on gastric emptying was greatest after a single dose 
of 5 mg and diminished after subsequent doses . Dose adjustments with concomitant use of insulin 
secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin  may be necessary ( see 7 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS  
and 8.2 Clinical Trial Adverse Reactions ). 
9.4 Drug -Drug Interactions   
The drugs listed in this table are based on either drug interaction case reports or studies, or potential 
interactions due to the expected magnitude and seriousness of the interaction (i.e., those identified as 
contraindicated).  
 
Table 5: Established or Potential Drug-Drug Interactions  
Proper/Common 
Name  Source of 
Evidence  Effect  Clinical Comment  
Acetaminophen  Clinical Trial  Following the first dose of 
tirzepatide 5  mg, acetaminophen 
Cmax was reduced by 50%, and 
the median t max occurred 1 hour 
later.  
After co -administration for 4 
weeks, there was no meaningful 
impact on acetaminophen C max 
and t max. Overall acetaminophen 
exposure (AUC 0-24hr) was not 
influenced.  No dose adjustment of 
acetaminophen is 
necessary when 
administered with 
tirzepatide.  
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 16 of 61 
 Oral Contraceptives  Clinical Trial  Administration of a combination 
oral contraceptive (0.035  mg 
ethinyl estradiol plus 0.25  mg 
norgestimate) in the presence of 
a single dose of tirzepatide (5  mg) 
resulted in a reduction of oral 
contraceptive C max by 55 to 66%, 
with a 16 to 23% reduction in 
AUC and a delay in t max of 2.5 to 
4.5 hours. These effects may be 
due to the impact of MOUNJARO 
on gastric emptying.  Advise patients using 
oral hormonal 
contraceptives to 
switch to a non -oral 
contraceptive method, 
or to add a barrier 
method of 
contraception for 4 
weeks after initiation 
and for 4 weeks after 
each dose escalation 
with MOUNJARO.  
Drugs that Increase 
Heart Rate  Clinical Trial  MOUNJARO resulted in a mean 
increase in heart rate of 2 to 4 
beats per minute. There was a 
mean increase in heart rate of 0.7 
beats per minute in placebo -
treated patients.  Caution should be 
observed if 
MOUNJARO is 
administered with other 
drugs that also 
increase heart rate, 
such as drugs with 
sympathomimetic or 
anticholinergic activity 
(see 7 WARNINGS 
AND PRECAUTIONS ). 
 
Drugs that Cause PR Interval or QTc Interval Prolongation  
In phase 3 clinical studies, no clinically meaningful treatment -emergent differences in PR interval or QTc 
duration were noted between placebo, tirzepatide, or comparators.  
A dedicated thorough QT study has not been conducted with MOUNJARO . 
9.5 Drug -Food Interactions   
Interactions with food have not been studied.  
9.6 Drug -Herb Interactions   
Interactions with herbal products have not been studied.  
9.7 Drug -Laboratory Test Interactions   
Interactions with laboratory tests have not been studied.  
9.8 Drug -Lifestyle Interactions   
No studies on the effects of the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. When MOUNJARO  is 
used in combination with a sulfonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid 
hypoglycemia while driving and using machines.  
10 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY   
10.1 Mechanism of Action   
Tirzepatide is a GIP  and a GLP-1 receptor agonist. It is a n amino acid sequence  with a C20 -fatty diacid moiety 
that enables albumin binding and prolong s the half-life. 
Tirzepatide is selective to human GIP and GLP -1 receptors. The activity  of tirzepatide on the GIP receptor is 
similar to native GIP hormone. The activity  of tirzepatide on the GLP -1 receptor is lower compared to native 
GLP-1 hormone.  
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 17 of 61 
 Tirzepatide enhances first - and second -phase insulin secretion, and reduces plasma glucagon levels, both in a 
glucose -dependent manner.  
10.2 Pharmacodynamics   
Tirzepatide lower s fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations through the mechanisms described below , 
and is associated with reduced food intake,  in patients with type  2 diabetes . 
Insulin Secretion  
In a hyperglycemic clamp study in patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus, tirzepatide 15  mg enhanced the first - 
and second -phase insulin secretion rate (Figure 1). 
 
Figure  1: Mean Insulin Concentration at 0 -120 Minutes During Hyperglycemic Clamp at Baseline and 
Week 28  
Insulin Sensitivity  
In a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp study, tirzepatide  15 mg increased whole -body insulin sensitivity by 
63%, as measured by M -value  at 28 weeks . The M -value was unchanged for patients receiving placebo. In this 
study , tirzepatide also lower ed body weight in patients with type  2 diabetes.  
Glucagon Concentration  
Tirzepatide reduces the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations . After 28 weeks of treatment , 
tirzepatide 15  mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28% and glucagon AUC after a mixed meal by 
43%, compared with no change for placebo.  
Gastric Emptying  
Tirzepatide delays  gastric emptying . The delay in gastric emptying  with tirzepatide is largest after the first dose 
and diminishes with subsequent doses.  
Vital Signs  
Blood Pressure  
In placebo -controlled Phase 3 trials, treatment with MOUNJARO  resulted in a mean decrease in systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure of 6 to 9 mmHg and 3 to 4 mmHg, respectively. There was a mean decrease in 
systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 2 mmHg each in placebo -treated patients.  

MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 18 of 61 
 Cardiac Electrophysiology  
In phase  3 clinical studies, no clinically meaningful treatment -emergent differences in PR interval or QTc 
duration were noted between placebo, MOUNJARO , or comparators. A dedicated thorough QT study has not 
been conducted with MOUNJARO . 
QTc and PR interval were evaluated using a population pharmacokinetic model -based analyses utilizing all 
data from healthy participants and patients with T2DM who were given either placebo or tirzepatide in one 
phase  1 study and two phase  2 studies.  Concentration -QTc analysis and concentration -PR interval analysis 
based upon these three studies  did not suggest an association between tirzepatide  and QTc prolongation or 
PR interval  duration . 
10.3 Pharmacokinetics   
The pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide is similar between healthy subjects  and patients with type  2 diabetes 
mellitus. Steady -state plasma tirzepatide concentrations were achieved following 4 weeks of once -weekly 
administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose -proportional manner.  
Absorption  
Following subcutaneous administration, the time to maximum plasma concentration of tirzepatide ranges from 
8 to 72 hours. The mean absolute bioavailability of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration was 80%. 
Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thi gh, or upper 
arm. 
Distribution  
The mean apparent steady -state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous administration in 
patients with type  2 diabetes is approximately 10.3  L. Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99%).  
Metabolism  
Tirzepatide is metabolized by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta -oxidation of the C20 -fatty 
diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis.  
Elimination  
The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are via urine and feces. Intact tirzepatide is not 
observed in urine or feces. The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is 0.061  L/h with an 
elimination half -life of approximately 5 days, enabling once -weekly dosing.  
Special Populations and Conditions  
 Pediatrics : tirzepatide has not been studied in pediatric patients.   
 Geriatrics : age had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide . 
 Sex: sex had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide . 
 Pregnancy and Breast -feeding : studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide in pregnant 
and breast -feeding patients have not been performed.  
 Ethnic O rigin : race had no clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide . 
 Hepatic Impairment : hepatic impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The 
pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5  mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of 
hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) compared with participants  with normal hepatic function  (see 
4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  and 7.1 Special Populations ). 
 Renal Impairment : renal impairment does not impact the pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide. The 
pharmacokinetics of tirzepatide after a single 5  mg dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of 
renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, ESRD) compared with participants  with normal renal function. 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 19 of 61 
 This was also shown for patients with both T2DM and mild, moderate or severe  renal insufficiency based 
on data from clinical studies (see 4 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION  and 7.1 Special Populations ). 
 Obesity : pharmacokinetic analyses have demonstrated a n observed  inverse relationship between body 
weight and tirzepatide  exposure, although there was no clinically relevant impact of weight on glycemic 
control.

A total of 6263  patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus and inadequate glycemic control were randomized, of 
whom 4199  received at least one dose of study drug, in 5 placebo - and/or active -controlled, glycemic control 
global p hase 3 studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MOUNJARO . Of these, 2082  (33%) patients were 
≥65 years and 317 (5%) were ≥75 years. Patients had an overall mean age of 59 years (range 18 to 91 years). 
55% were male and 45% were female. The racial distribution of patients in these studies was 81% White, 7% 
Asian, 4% African American, and 8% other racial origin. The mean body mass index (BMI) overall was 
33 kg/m2 at baseline, and the duration of diabetes was 9.6 years.  
Monotherapy Use of MOUNJARO  in Patients with Type  2 Diabetes Mellitus  (SURPASS -1) 
SURPASS -1 was a 40 -week double -blind trial that randomized 478 patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus with 
inadequate glycemic control with diet and exercise to MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, or 15  mg once weekly or 
placebo.  
Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 52% were men. The mean duration of type  2 diabetes mellitus was 
4.7 years and the mean BMI was 32  kg/m2. Overall, 36% were White, 5% were Black or African American, and 
35% were Asian; 43% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  
Monotherapy with MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg and 15  mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically 
significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo ( see Table  8).

SURPASS -3 was a 52 -week open -label trial that randomized 1444 patients with type  2 diabetes mellitus with 
inadequate glycemic control on stable doses of metformin with or without SGLT2i  to once weekly MOUNJARO  
5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg, or titrated insulin degludec 100  units/mL once daily. 32% of patients were on SGLT2i.  
Patients randomized to insulin degludec initially received 10  units once daily. The dose was adjusted weekly 
throughout the trial using a treat -to-target algorithm based on self -measured fasting b lood glucose values, 
targeting <5  mmol/L. By the primary endpoint at Week 52, the mean daily insulin degludec dose was 49 U 
(0.5 U per kilogram) per day.  
Patients had a mean age of 57 years and 56% were men. The mean duration of type  2 diabetes mellitus was 
8.4 years and the mean BMI was 34  kg/m2. Overall, 91% were White, 3% were Black or African American, and 
5% were Asian; 29% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  
Treatment with MOUNJARO  10 mg and 15  mg once weekly for 52 weeks resulted in a statistically significant 
reduction in HbA1c compared with daily insulin degludec ( see Table  10 and Figure  3).

and 18% were Asian; 5% identified as Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  
The mean starting dose of insulin glargine was 34, 32, 35, and 33 units/day for patients receiving MOUNJARO  
5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg, and placebo, respectively. At randomization, the initial insulin glargine dose in patients 
with HbA1c ≤8.0% was reduced by 20%. At week 40, mean dose of insulin glargine was 38, 36, 29, and 
59 units/day for patients receiving MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg, 15  mg, and placebo, respectively.  
Treatment with MOUNJARO  5 mg, 10  mg and 15  mg once weekly for 40 weeks resulted in a statistically 
significant reduction in HbA1c compared with placebo ( see Table  13).

15 MICROBIOLOGY   
No microbiological information is required for this drug product.  
16 NON -CLINICAL TOXICOLOGY   
General Toxicology : Tirzepatide was administered twice weekly  by subcutaneous injection to rats and 
cynomolgus monkeys , at doses up to  3 mg/kg  (1.96x human exposure  based on AUC ) and 0.5  mg/kg  (1.35x 
human exposure  based on AUC ), respectively. Primary findings were consistent with the activity of incretins , 
including GLP -1R agonists, and included  significantly  decreased food consumption an d body weight loss.  
Carcinogenicity : A 2-year carcinogenicity study  (lifetime exposure)  was conducted with tirzepatide in male 
and female rats , administered twice weekly by subcutaneous injection, at doses of 0.15, 0.5, and 1.5  mg/kg 
(0.1-, 0.4-, and 1 -fold the maximum recommended human dose ( MRHD ) of 15  mg once weekly based on 
AUC). Tirzepatide caused an increase in thyroid C -cell tumors (adenomas and carcinomas  combined ) in both 
sexes at all dose levels.  
In a 6 -month carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice, tirzepatide at doses of 1, 3, and 10  mg/kg 
administered twice weekly by subcutaneous injection was not tumorigenic . 
Genotoxicity : Tirzepatide was not genotoxic in a rat bone marrow micronucleus assay  at single SC -
administered doses up to 3  mg/kg.  
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology : In fertility and early embryonic development studies, male 
and female rats were administered tirzepatide twice weekly  by subcutaneous injection at doses of 0.5, 1.5, or 
3 mg/kg (0.3 -, 1-, and 2-fold and 0. 3-, 0.9-, and 2-fold, respectively, the MRHD of 15  mg once weekly based on 
AUC). No effects of tirzepatide were observed on sperm morphology, mating, fertility, and conception. 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 32 of 61 
 However,  in female rats, an increase in the number of females with prolonged diestrus and a decrease in the 
mean number of corpora lutea resulting in a decrease in the mean number of implantation sites and viable 
embryos was observed at all dose levels. These effect s were considered secondary to the pharmacological 
effects of tirzepatide on food consumption and body weight.  
Pregnant rats  were  given twice weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.02, 0.1, and 0.5  mg/kg tirzepatide (0.03 -, 0.1-, 
and 0.5 -fold the MRHD of 15  mg once weekly based on AUC) during organogenesis . Increased  incidences of 
external, visceral, and skeletal malformations, increased incidences of visceral and skeletal developmental 
variations, and reduced  fetal weights were observed, in addition to decreases  in maternal body weights and 
food consumption , at 0.5  mg/kg.  
Pregnant rabbits  were  given tirzepatide once weekly subcutaneous doses of 0.01, 0.03, or 0.1  mg/kg (0.01 -, 
0.1-, and 0.23 -fold the MRHD) during organogenesis . Adverse effects on the gastrointestinal system resulting 
in maternal mortality or abortion in a few rabbits were observed  at all dose levels. Reduced fetal weights , 
decreased maternal food consumption and  decreased maternal  body weights were observed at 0.1  mg/kg.  
In a prenatal -postnatal study in F 0 maternal rats administered tirzepatide twice weekly by  subcutaneous  
injection at  doses of 0.02, 0.10, or 0.25  mg/kg from implantation through lactation, F 1 pups from F 0 maternal 
rats given 0.25  mg/kg tirzepatide had lower mean body weight from birth through the end of the study  for males 
and postnatal day 56 for females.  
Juvenile Toxicity : Consistent with adult rats, in a juvenile toxicity study in rats, effects were limited to 
pharmacological effects  of tirzepatide  on body weight and food consumption and other reversible effects 
secondary to tirzepatide  pharmacology. Tirzepatide led to a delay in sexual maturity in male and female rats, 
which was attributed to the reduced body weight gain during treatment. These data indicate that tirzepatide 
does not have specific  toxicities in juvenile animals.

The information below applies to MOUNJARO and MOUNJARO KwikPen unless otherwise indicated.  
Read this carefully before you start taking MOUNJARO  and each time you get a refill. This leaflet is a summary 
and will not tell you everything about this drug . Talk to your healthcare professional  about your medical 
condition and treatment and ask if there is any new information about MOUNJARO . 
 
Serious Warnings and Precautions  
 Tirzepatide , the medicinal ingredient in MOUNJARO,  increased the risk of 
developing thyroid C -cell tumors in rats. It is not known if the risk seen in rats applies 
to humans . It is uncertain if  MOUNJARO  may increase your risk for developing 
thyroid C -cell tumors, including medullary thyroid carcinoma.  
 
 Do not use MOUNJARO  if you: 
▪ have a personal or family history of Medullary Thyroid Cancer (MTC);  
▪ have Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2).  
 
 Your healthcare professional will speak to you about the risk and symptoms of 
thyroid tumors.  
 
What is MOUNJARO  used for ? 
MOUNJARO  is used along with diet and exercise to : 
 improve blood sugar levels in adults with type 2 diabetes.  
MOUNJARO  is used:  
▪ alone, if you cannot take metformin;  
▪ with metformin;  
▪ with metformin and a sulfonylurea;  
▪ with metformin and a sodium -glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor  (SGLT2i) ; 
▪ with basal insulin (with or without metformin) . 
How does MOUNJARO  work?  
MOUNJARO  belongs to a class of medicines called GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonists . MOUNJARO  lowers 
your blood sugar by helping your body release more insulin when your blood sugar is high.  It also reduces 
levels of glucagon, a hormone that prevents blood sugar from decreasing too much.

 Tell your healthcare professional about all the medicines you take, including any drugs , vitamins, 
minerals, natural supplements or alternative medicines.  
The following may interact with MOUNJARO : 
 oral birth control medicines . 
 anti-diabetic medicines known as a sulfonylurea (e.g., glyburide, gliclazide, glimepiride) or insulin. 
Combining these medicines with MOUNJARO  might increase the risk of getting low blood sugar. Your 
healthcare professional may tell you to lower your regular dose of these drugs when adding 
MOUNJARO  treatment.  
 medicines that may increase your heart rate.  
other incretin medicines . The use of MOUNJARO in combination with other GLP-1 receptor agonists or 
with DPP-4 inhibitors  has not been studied and MOUNJARO should not be used in combination with 
those drugs.  
How to take MOUNJARO : 
 Take MOUNJARO  exactly as your healthcare professional  has prescribed.  Do not change your dose or 
stop taking  MOUNJARO without talking to your healthcare professional.  
 Set a reminder on a calendar to remind yourself of your weekly dose.

o 4 different pens or vials if you are using MOUNJARO single -dose prefilled pen, or single -dose vial. 
o 1 pen if you are using multi -dose prefilled MOUNJARO KwikPen . 
How to inject MOUNJARO : 
 MOUNJARO  is an injection which is given under the skin (subcutaneously).  Do not inject MOUNJARO  into 
a vein or muscle.  
 The best places to give yourself the injection are your stomach area (abdomen)  or upper leg (thigh) . 
Another person should give you the injection in the back of  your upper arm.  
 Do not use the same site for each injection. Change (rotate) your injection site with each weekly injection.  
Your dose of MOUNJARO  may change depending on:  
 if you are taking other diabetic medication  
 your physical health (e.g. , weight, illness, physical activity)  
 your diet  
Changing the day of your weekly injection : 
 If necessary , you can change the day of your weekly injection . There has to be at least 3 days since your 
last injection of MOUNJARO . 
MOUNJARO  and MOUNJARO KwikPen (tirzepatide injection)   Page 38 of 61 
 If you give yourself insulin in addition to MOUNJARO : 
 Never mix both medications (Insulin and MOUNJARO)  in the same container. Give yourself separate 
injections of insulin and MOUNJARO . 
 You may give both injections in the same body area (for example, your stomach area), but not right next to 
each other.  
Usual adult dose:  
 The recommended starting dose of MOUNJARO is 2.5 mg administered subcutaneously (under the skin ) 
once weekly. After 4 weeks your dose will go up to 5  mg once weekly. If needed, the dose may be 
increased by 2.5  mg after at least 4 weeks on your current dose . The maximum recommended dose is 
15 mg once  weekly.  
 If your healthcare professional increases your dose, a new  MOUNJARO (pen, vial  or KwikPen) for the 
different dose should be used.  
Overdose:  
If you think you, or a person you are caring for, have taken too much MOUNJARO , contact a 
healthcare professional, hospital emergency department, or regional poison control centre 
immediately, even if there are no symptoms.  
 
Missed dose: 
If you miss a dose and:  
 it has been  4 days  (96 hours)  or less since you should have used MOUNJARO , use it as soon as you 
remember. Then inject your next dose on your usual scheduled day.  
 it has been  more than 4 days (96 hours)  since you should have used MOUNJARO , skip the missed dose. 
Then inject your next dose on your usual scheduled day .

  Throw away the KwikPen after receiving the 4 weekly doses contained in the pen in a sharps disposal 
container. Attempting to inject any leftover medicine could result in an incomplete dose even though the 
KwikPen still has medication left in it.  
 
Keep your KwikPen, needles, sharps container and all medicines out of the sight and reach of children.  
 
Disposing of MOUNJARO KwikPen and needles  
 
 Put your used pen needles in a sharps disposal container right away after use.  
 Do not  throw away loose pen needles in your household trash.  
 MOUNJARO KwikPen contains 4 doses. Discard your KwikPen after using it once per week for 4 weeks (4 
doses). Put all used KwikPens into a puncture -resistant (sharps) container once all the doses have been 
used. There may be some medicine still left in the pen after the 4 weekly doses were given.  
 If you do not have a sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is:  
– made of a heavy -duty plastic,  
– can be closed with a tight -fitting, puncture -resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out,  
– upright and stable during use,  
– leak-resistant, and  
– properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.  
 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, follow your community guidelines for the right way to 
dispose of it. There may be local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. Talk 
to your healthcare professional about how to d ispose of your sharps container.  
 Do not  recycle your used sharps disposal container.  
 
Troubleshooting  
 
 If you cannot remove the KwikPen cap, gently twist the KwikPen cap back and forth, and then pull the 
KwikPen cap straight off.  
 If the dose knob is hard to push:  
– pushing the dose knob more slowly will make it easier to inject.  
– your needle may be blocked. Put on a new pen needle and prime the KwikPen.  
– you may have dust, food, or liquid inside the KwikPen. Throw the KwikPen away in a sharps disposal 
container and get a new KwikPen.  
 If the KwikPen prevents you from turning the dose knob until the  is in the dose window:  
– Throw away the KwikPen, including the unused medicine in a sharps disposal container. There may not 
be enough medicine left in the KwikPen to give a full dose. Do not attempt to inject the leftover 
medicine.
